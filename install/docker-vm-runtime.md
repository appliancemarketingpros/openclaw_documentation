Docker VM Runtime

# 

​

Docker VM Runtime

Shared runtime steps for VM-based Docker installs such as GCP, Hetzner, and similar VPS providers.

## 

​

Bake required binaries into the image

Installing binaries inside a running container is a trap. Anything installed at runtime will be lost on restart. All external binaries required by skills must be installed at image build time. The examples below show three common binaries only:

  * `gog` for Gmail access
  * `goplaces` for Google Places
  * `wacli` for WhatsApp

These are examples, not a complete list. You may install as many binaries as needed using the same pattern. If you add new skills later that depend on additional binaries, you must:

  1. Update the Dockerfile
  2. Rebuild the image
  3. Restart the containers

**Example Dockerfile**

Copy
[code]
    FROM node:24-bookworm
    
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y socat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    
    # Example binary 1: Gmail CLI
    RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/gog/releases/latest/download/gog_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
      | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gog
    
    # Example binary 2: Google Places CLI
    RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/goplaces/releases/latest/download/goplaces_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
      | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/goplaces
    
    # Example binary 3: WhatsApp CLI
    RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/wacli/releases/latest/download/wacli_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
      | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wacli
    
    # Add more binaries below using the same pattern
    
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-workspace.yaml .npmrc ./
    COPY ui/package.json ./ui/package.json
    COPY scripts ./scripts
    
    RUN corepack enable
    RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    
    COPY . .
    RUN pnpm build
    RUN pnpm ui:install
    RUN pnpm ui:build
    
    ENV NODE_ENV=production
    
    CMD ["node","dist/index.js"]
    
[/code]

The download URLs above are for x86_64 (amd64). For ARM-based VMs (e.g. Hetzner ARM, GCP Tau T2A), replace the download URLs with the appropriate ARM64 variants from each tool’s release page.

Build and launch

Copy
[code]
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway
    
[/code]

If build fails with `Killed` or `exit code 137` during `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, the VM is out of memory. Use a larger machine class before retrying. Verify binaries:

Copy
[code]
    docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which gog
    docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which goplaces
    docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which wacli
    
[/code]

Expected output:

Copy
[code]
    /usr/local/bin/gog
    /usr/local/bin/goplaces
    /usr/local/bin/wacli
    
[/code]

Verify Gateway:

Copy
[code]
    docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway
    
[/code]

Expected output:

Copy
[code]
    [gateway] listening on ws://0.0.0.0:18789
    
[/code]

What persists where

OpenClaw runs in Docker, but Docker is not the source of truth. All long-lived state must survive restarts, rebuilds, and reboots.

Component| Location| Persistence mechanism| Notes  
---|---|---|---  
Gateway config| `/home/node/.openclaw/`| Host volume mount| Includes `openclaw.json`, tokens  
Model auth profiles| `/home/node/.openclaw/`| Host volume mount| OAuth tokens, API keys  
Skill configs| `/home/node/.openclaw/skills/`| Host volume mount| Skill-level state  
Agent workspace| `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/`| Host volume mount| Code and agent artifacts  
WhatsApp session| `/home/node/.openclaw/`| Host volume mount| Preserves QR login  
Gmail keyring| `/home/node/.openclaw/`| Host volume + password| Requires `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD`  
External binaries| `/usr/local/bin/`| Docker image| Must be baked at build time  
Node runtime| Container filesystem| Docker image| Rebuilt every image build  
OS packages| Container filesystem| Docker image| Do not install at runtime  
Docker container| Ephemeral| Restartable| Safe to destroy

Updates

To update OpenClaw on the VM:

Copy
[code]
    git pull
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d
    
[/code]
