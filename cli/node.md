Tools and execution

node

# 

​

`openclaw node`

Run a **headless node host** that connects to the Gateway WebSocket and exposes `system.run` / `system.which` on this machine.

## 

​

Why use a node host?

Use a node host when you want agents to **run commands on other machines** in your network without installing a full macOS companion app there. Common use cases:

  * Run commands on remote Linux/Windows boxes (build servers, lab machines, NAS).
  * Keep exec **sandboxed** on the gateway, but delegate approved runs to other hosts.
  * Provide a lightweight, headless execution target for automation or CI nodes.

Execution is still guarded by **exec approvals** and per‑agent allowlists on the node host, so you can keep command access scoped and explicit.

## 

​

Browser proxy (zero-config)

Node hosts automatically advertise a browser proxy if `browser.enabled` is not disabled on the node. This lets the agent use browser automation on that node without extra configuration. Disable it on the node if needed:

Copy
[code]
    {
      nodeHost: {
        browserProxy: {
          enabled: false,
        },
      },
    }
    
[/code]

## 

​

Run (foreground)

Copy
[code]
    openclaw node run --host <gateway-host> --port 18789
    
[/code]

Options:

  * `--host <host>`: Gateway WebSocket host (default: `127.0.0.1`)
  * `--port <port>`: Gateway WebSocket port (default: `18789`)
  * `--tls`: Use TLS for the gateway connection
  * `--tls-fingerprint <sha256>`: Expected TLS certificate fingerprint (sha256)
  * `--node-id <id>`: Override node id (clears pairing token)
  * `--display-name <name>`: Override the node display name


## 

​

Gateway auth for node host

`openclaw node run` and `openclaw node install` resolve gateway auth from config/env (no `--token`/`--password` flags on node commands):

  * `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` are checked first.
  * Then local config fallback: `gateway.auth.token` / `gateway.auth.password`.
  * In local mode, node host intentionally does not inherit `gateway.remote.token` / `gateway.remote.password`.
  * If `gateway.auth.token` / `gateway.auth.password` is explicitly configured via SecretRef and unresolved, node auth resolution fails closed (no remote fallback masking).
  * In `gateway.mode=remote`, remote client fields (`gateway.remote.token` / `gateway.remote.password`) are also eligible per remote precedence rules.
  * Legacy `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_*` env vars are ignored for node host auth resolution.


## 

​

Service (background)

Install a headless node host as a user service.

Copy
[code]
    openclaw node install --host <gateway-host> --port 18789
    
[/code]

Options:

  * `--host <host>`: Gateway WebSocket host (default: `127.0.0.1`)
  * `--port <port>`: Gateway WebSocket port (default: `18789`)
  * `--tls`: Use TLS for the gateway connection
  * `--tls-fingerprint <sha256>`: Expected TLS certificate fingerprint (sha256)
  * `--node-id <id>`: Override node id (clears pairing token)
  * `--display-name <name>`: Override the node display name
  * `--runtime <runtime>`: Service runtime (`node` or `bun`)
  * `--force`: Reinstall/overwrite if already installed

Manage the service:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw node status
    openclaw node stop
    openclaw node restart
    openclaw node uninstall
    
[/code]

Use `openclaw node run` for a foreground node host (no service). Service commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.

## 

​

Pairing

The first connection creates a pending device pairing request (`role: node`) on the Gateway. Approve it via:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw devices list
    openclaw devices approve <requestId>
    
[/code]

If the node retries pairing with changed auth details (role/scopes/public key), the previous pending request is superseded and a new `requestId` is created. Run `openclaw devices list` again before approval. The node host stores its node id, token, display name, and gateway connection info in `~/.openclaw/node.json`.

## 

​

Exec approvals

`system.run` is gated by local exec approvals:

  * `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`
  * [Exec approvals](</tools/exec-approvals>)
  * `openclaw approvals --node <id|name|ip>` (edit from the Gateway)
