macOS Permissions

​

macOS permissions (TCC)

macOS permission grants are fragile. TCC associates a permission grant with the app’s code signature, bundle identifier, and on-disk path. If any of those change, macOS treats the app as new and may drop or hide prompts.

## 

​

Requirements for stable permissions

  * Same path: run the app from a fixed location (for OpenClaw, `dist/OpenClaw.app`).
  * Same bundle identifier: changing the bundle ID creates a new permission identity.
  * Signed app: unsigned or ad-hoc signed builds do not persist permissions.
  * Consistent signature: use a real Apple Development or Developer ID certificate so the signature stays stable across rebuilds.

Ad-hoc signatures generate a new identity every build. macOS will forget previous grants, and prompts can disappear entirely until the stale entries are cleared.

## 

​

Recovery checklist when prompts disappear

  1. Quit the app.
  2. Remove the app entry in System Settings -> Privacy & Security.
  3. Relaunch the app from the same path and re-grant permissions.
  4. If the prompt still does not appear, reset TCC entries with `tccutil` and try again.
  5. Some permissions only reappear after a full macOS restart.

Example resets (replace bundle ID as needed):

Copy
[code]
    sudo tccutil reset Accessibility ai.openclaw.mac
    sudo tccutil reset ScreenCapture ai.openclaw.mac
    sudo tccutil reset AppleEvents
    
[/code]

Files and folders permissions (Desktop/Documents/Downloads)

macOS may also gate Desktop, Documents, and Downloads for terminal/background processes. If file reads or directory listings hang, grant access to the same process context that performs file operations (for example Terminal/iTerm, LaunchAgent-launched app, or SSH process). Workaround: move files into the OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`) if you want to avoid per-folder grants. If you are testing permissions, always sign with a real certificate. Ad-hoc builds are only acceptable for quick local runs where permissions do not matter.
