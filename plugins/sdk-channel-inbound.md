Channel plugins should model receive paths with inbound and message nouns:

textCopy code
[code]
    platform event -> inbound facts/context -> agent reply -> message delivery
[/code]

Use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound` for inbound event normalization, formatting, roots, and orchestration. Use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-outbound` for native send, receipt, durable delivery, and live preview behavior.

## Core Helpers

tsCopy code
[code]
       buildChannelInboundEventContext,  runChannelInboundEvent,  dispatchChannelInboundReply,} from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound";
[/code]

  * `buildChannelInboundEventContext(...)`: project normalized channel facts into the prompt/session context.
  * `runChannelInboundEvent(...)`: run ingest, classify, preflight, resolve, record, dispatch, and finalize for one inbound platform event.
  * `dispatchChannelInboundReply(...)`: record and dispatch an already assembled inbound reply with a delivery adapter.


The injected plugin runtime exposes the same high-level helpers under `runtime.channel.inbound.*` for bundled/native channels that already receive the runtime object.

tsCopy code
[code]
    await runtime.channel.inbound.run({  channel: "demo",  accountId,  raw: platformEvent,  adapter: {    ingest: normalizePlatformEvent,    resolveTurn: resolveInboundReply,  },});
[/code]

Compatibility dispatchers should assemble `dispatchChannelInboundReply(...)` inputs and keep platform delivery in the delivery adapter. New send paths should prefer message adapters and durable message helpers.

## Migration

The old `runtime.channel.turn.*` runtime aliases were removed. Use:

  * `runtime.channel.inbound.run(...)` for raw inbound events.
  * `runtime.channel.inbound.dispatchReply(...)` for assembled reply contexts.
  * `runtime.channel.inbound.buildContext(...)` for inbound context payloads.
  * `runtime.channel.inbound.runPreparedReply(...)` only for channel-owned prepared dispatch paths that already assemble their own dispatch closure.


New plugin code should not introduce `turn`-named channel APIs. Keep model or agent turn vocabulary inside agent/provider code; channel plugins use inbound, message, delivery, and reply terms.
