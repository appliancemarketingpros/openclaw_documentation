xAI

OpenClaw ships a bundled `xai` provider plugin for Grok models.

## 

​

Setup

  1. Create an API key in the xAI console.
  2. Set `XAI_API_KEY`, or run:


Copy
[code]
    openclaw onboard --auth-choice xai-api-key
    
[/code]

  3. Pick a model such as:


Copy
[code]
    {
      agents: { defaults: { model: { primary: "xai/grok-4" } } },
    }
    
[/code]

## 

​

Current bundled model catalog

OpenClaw now includes these xAI model families out of the box:

  * `grok-4`, `grok-4-0709`
  * `grok-4-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`
  * `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning`
  * `grok-4.20-experimental-beta-0304-reasoning`
  * `grok-4.20-experimental-beta-0304-non-reasoning`
  * `grok-code-fast-1`

The plugin also forward-resolves newer `grok-4*` and `grok-code-fast*` ids when they follow the same API shape.

## 

​

Web search

The bundled `grok` web-search provider uses `XAI_API_KEY` too:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw config set tools.web.search.provider grok
    
[/code]

## 

​

Known limits

  * Auth is API-key only today. There is no xAI OAuth/device-code flow in OpenClaw yet.
  * `grok-4.20-multi-agent-experimental-beta-0304` is not supported on the normal xAI provider path because it requires a different upstream API surface than the standard OpenClaw xAI transport.
  * Native xAI server-side tools such as `x_search` and `code_execution` are not yet first-class model-provider features in the bundled plugin.


## 

​

Notes

  * OpenClaw applies xAI-specific tool-schema and tool-call compatibility fixes automatically on the shared runner path.
  * For the broader provider overview, see [Model providers](</providers/index>).
