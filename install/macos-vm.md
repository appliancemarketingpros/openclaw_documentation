OpenClaw on macOS VMs (Sandboxing)

## 

​

Recommended default (most users)

  * **Small Linux VPS** for an always-on Gateway and low cost. See [VPS hosting](</vps>).
  * **Dedicated hardware** (Mac mini or Linux box) if you want full control and a **residential IP** for browser automation. Many sites block data center IPs, so local browsing often works better.
  * **Hybrid:** keep the Gateway on a cheap VPS, and connect your Mac as a **node** when you need browser/UI automation. See [Nodes](</nodes>) and [Gateway remote](</gateway/remote>).

Use a macOS VM when you specifically need macOS-only capabilities (iMessage/BlueBubbles) or want strict isolation from your daily Mac.

## 

​

macOS VM options

### 

​

Local VM on your Apple Silicon Mac (Lume)

Run OpenClaw in a sandboxed macOS VM on your existing Apple Silicon Mac using [Lume](<https://cua.ai/docs/lume>). This gives you:

  * Full macOS environment in isolation (your host stays clean)
  * iMessage support via BlueBubbles (impossible on Linux/Windows)
  * Instant reset by cloning VMs
  * No extra hardware or cloud costs


### 

​

Hosted Mac providers (cloud)

If you want macOS in the cloud, hosted Mac providers work too:

  * [MacStadium](<https://www.macstadium.com/>) (hosted Macs)
  * Other hosted Mac vendors also work; follow their VM + SSH docs

Once you have SSH access to a macOS VM, continue at step 6 below.

* * *

## 

​

Quick path (Lume, experienced users)

  1. Install Lume
  2. `lume create openclaw --os macos --ipsw latest`
  3. Complete Setup Assistant, enable Remote Login (SSH)
  4. `lume run openclaw --no-display`
  5. SSH in, install OpenClaw, configure channels
  6. Done


* * *

## 

​

What you need (Lume)

  * Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)
  * macOS Sequoia or later on the host
  * ~60 GB free disk space per VM
  * ~20 minutes


* * *

## 

​

1) Install Lume

Copy
[code]
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
    
[/code]

If `~/.local/bin` isn’t in your PATH:

Copy
[code]
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
    
[/code]

Verify:

Copy
[code]
    lume --version
    
[/code]

Docs: [Lume Installation](<https://cua.ai/docs/lume/guide/getting-started/installation>)

* * *

## 

​

2) Create the macOS VM

Copy
[code]
    lume create openclaw --os macos --ipsw latest
    
[/code]

This downloads macOS and creates the VM. A VNC window opens automatically. Note: The download can take a while depending on your connection.

* * *

## 

​

3) Complete Setup Assistant

In the VNC window:

  1. Select language and region
  2. Skip Apple ID (or sign in if you want iMessage later)
  3. Create a user account (remember the username and password)
  4. Skip all optional features

After setup completes, enable SSH:

  1. Open System Settings → General → Sharing
  2. Enable “Remote Login”


* * *

## 

​

4) Get the VM IP address

Copy
[code]
    lume get openclaw
    
[/code]

Look for the IP address (usually `192.168.64.x`).

* * *

## 

​

5) SSH into the VM

Copy
[code]
    ssh youruser@192.168.64.X
    
[/code]

Replace `youruser` with the account you created, and the IP with your VM’s IP.

* * *

## 

​

6) Install OpenClaw

Inside the VM:

Copy
[code]
    npm install -g openclaw@latest
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    
[/code]

Follow the onboarding prompts to set up your model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).

* * *

## 

​

7) Configure channels

Edit the config file:

Copy
[code]
    nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
    
[/code]

Add your channels:

Copy
[code]
    {
      channels: {
        whatsapp: {
          dmPolicy: "allowlist",
          allowFrom: ["+15551234567"],
        },
        telegram: {
          botToken: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
        },
      },
    }
    
[/code]

Then login to WhatsApp (scan QR):

Copy
[code]
    openclaw channels login
    
[/code]

* * *

## 

​

8) Run the VM headlessly

Stop the VM and restart without display:

Copy
[code]
    lume stop openclaw
    lume run openclaw --no-display
    
[/code]

The VM runs in the background. OpenClaw’s daemon keeps the gateway running. To check status:

Copy
[code]
    ssh youruser@192.168.64.X "openclaw status"
    
[/code]

* * *

## 

​

Bonus: iMessage integration

This is the killer feature of running on macOS. Use [BlueBubbles](<https://bluebubbles.app>) to add iMessage to OpenClaw. Inside the VM:

  1. Download BlueBubbles from bluebubbles.app
  2. Sign in with your Apple ID
  3. Enable the Web API and set a password
  4. Point BlueBubbles webhooks at your gateway (example: `https://your-gateway-host:3000/bluebubbles-webhook?password=<password>`)

Add to your OpenClaw config:

Copy
[code]
    {
      channels: {
        bluebubbles: {
          serverUrl: "http://localhost:1234",
          password: "your-api-password",
          webhookPath: "/bluebubbles-webhook",
        },
      },
    }
    
[/code]

Restart the gateway. Now your agent can send and receive iMessages. Full setup details: [BlueBubbles channel](</channels/bluebubbles>)

* * *

## 

​

Save a golden image

Before customizing further, snapshot your clean state:

Copy
[code]
    lume stop openclaw
    lume clone openclaw openclaw-golden
    
[/code]

Reset anytime:

Copy
[code]
    lume stop openclaw && lume delete openclaw
    lume clone openclaw-golden openclaw
    lume run openclaw --no-display
    
[/code]

* * *

## 

​

Running 24/7

Keep the VM running by:

  * Keeping your Mac plugged in
  * Disabling sleep in System Settings → Energy Saver
  * Using `caffeinate` if needed

For true always-on, consider a dedicated Mac mini or a small VPS. See [VPS hosting](</vps>).

* * *

## 

​

Troubleshooting

Problem| Solution  
---|---  
Can’t SSH into VM| Check “Remote Login” is enabled in VM’s System Settings  
VM IP not showing| Wait for VM to fully boot, run `lume get openclaw` again  
Lume command not found| Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH  
WhatsApp QR not scanning| Ensure you’re logged into the VM (not host) when running `openclaw channels login`
