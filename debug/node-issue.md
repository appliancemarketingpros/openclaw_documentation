Node + tsx Crash

# 

​

Node + tsx “__name is not a function” crash

## 

​

Summary

Running OpenClaw via Node with `tsx` fails at startup with:

Copy
[code]
    [openclaw] Failed to start CLI: TypeError: __name is not a function
        at createSubsystemLogger (.../src/logging/subsystem.ts:203:25)
        at .../src/agents/auth-profiles/constants.ts:25:20
    
[/code]

This began after switching dev scripts from Bun to `tsx` (commit `2871657e`, 2026-01-06). The same runtime path worked with Bun.

## 

​

Environment

  * Node: v25.x (observed on v25.3.0)
  * tsx: 4.21.0
  * OS: macOS (repro also likely on other platforms that run Node 25)


## 

​

Repro (Node-only)

Copy
[code]
    # in repo root
    node --version
    pnpm install
    node --import tsx src/entry.ts status
    
[/code]

## 

​

Minimal repro in repo

Copy
[code]
    node --import tsx scripts/repro/tsx-name-repro.ts
    
[/code]

## 

​

Node version check

  * Node 25.3.0: fails
  * Node 22.22.0 (Homebrew `node@22`): fails
  * Node 24: not installed here yet; needs verification


## 

​

Notes / hypothesis

  * `tsx` uses esbuild to transform TS/ESM. esbuild’s `keepNames` emits a `__name` helper and wraps function definitions with `__name(...)`.
  * The crash indicates `__name` exists but is not a function at runtime, which implies the helper is missing or overwritten for this module in the Node 25 loader path.
  * Similar `__name` helper issues have been reported in other esbuild consumers when the helper is missing or rewritten.


## 

​

Regression history

  * `2871657e` (2026-01-06): scripts changed from Bun to tsx to make Bun optional.
  * Before that (Bun path), `openclaw status` and `gateway:watch` worked.


## 

​

Workarounds

  * Use Bun for dev scripts (current temporary revert).
  * Use Node + tsc watch, then run compiled output:

Copy
[code]pnpm exec tsc --watch --preserveWatchOutput
        node --watch openclaw.mjs status
        
[/code]

  * Confirmed locally: `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.json` \+ `node openclaw.mjs status` works on Node 25.
  * Disable esbuild keepNames in the TS loader if possible (prevents `__name` helper insertion); tsx does not currently expose this.
  * Test Node LTS (22/24) with `tsx` to see if the issue is Node 25–specific.

Next steps

  * Repro on Node 22/24 to confirm Node 25 regression.
  * Test `tsx` nightly or pin to earlier version if a known regression exists.
  * If reproduces on Node LTS, file a minimal repro upstream with the `__name` stack trace.
